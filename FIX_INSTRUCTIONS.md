# CRITICAL FIXES REQUIRED 🚨

The feedback indicates three main issues. Please follow these steps **exactly** to pass.

## Step 1: Fix the Code locally

I have already updated `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` to fix the missing email address issue. You need to push this change.

1. Open your terminal in `d:\Projects\git coursera`.
2. Run these commands:
   ```bash
   git add CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md
   git commit -m "Fix enforcement email in Code of Conduct"
   git push origin main
   ```

## Step 2: Rename your Repository on GitHub ⚠️

**This is the most important step.** The "Grading Feedback" explicitly states that your repository name is wrong.

1. Go to your GitHub repository page (currently `github-coursera`).
2. Click on **Settings** (tab).
3. In the "General" section, looking for "Repository name".
4. Change the name from `github-coursera` (or whatever it is) to:
   **`github-final-project`**
5. Click **Rename**.

## Step 3: Resubmit the Assignment

Go back to Coursera and update your answers. Make sure you submit the **Correct URLs** based on your **Renamed Repository**.

### Question 1 (README.md)
*   **Correction:** You previously submitted the link to `simple-interest.sh`. You MUST submit the link to **`README.md`**.
*   **Correct Link Format:**
    `https://github.com/<YOUR_USERNAME>/github-final-project/blob/main/README.md`

### Question 2 (LICENSE)
*   **Correction:** Ensure you use the new repo name in the URL.
*   **Correct Link Format:**
    `https://github.com/<YOUR_USERNAME>/github-final-project/blob/main/LICENSE`

### Question 3 (CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
*   **Correction:** I fixed the content locally. After pushing (Step 1), this link will be correct.
*   **Correct Link Format:**
    `https://github.com/<YOUR_USERNAME>/github-final-project/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`

### Question 4 (CONTRIBUTING.md)
*   **Correction:** The grader specifically checked for the repository name `github-final-project`. Renaming the repo (Step 2) fixes this.
*   **Correct Link Format:**
    `https://github.com/<YOUR_USERNAME>/github-final-project/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md`

### Question 5 (simple-interest.sh)
*   **Correct Link Format:**
    `https://github.com/<YOUR_USERNAME>/github-final-project/blob/main/simple-interest.sh`
